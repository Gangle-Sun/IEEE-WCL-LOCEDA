This code implements the LOw-Coherence sEquence Design Algorithm (LOCEDA) from our WCL paper [1], which can generate sequences with (i) low-coherence, (ii) arbitrary lengths, (iii) any number of sequences, (iv) support for adaptable subcarrier assignments in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and (v) compliance with user-defined PAPR constraints.
